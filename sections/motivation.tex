\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

This is the most important section of a systems paper.
A good motivation section is one that clearly motivates the problem and hints the solution.
Especially for the problem, it should be clear that the problem actually exists, is challenging to solve, and if solved, yields significant benefits.
You should also try to quantify the \emph{upper bound} of benefits in ideal circumstances.
