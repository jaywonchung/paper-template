A good paper actually \emph{looks} like a good paper.
I mean visually, when you page it through.
Figures are beautiful, equations are typeset nicely, text is well laid out without orphans and widows, and it fills 12 pages perfectly without any extra space.
The majority of pages, if not all, have some kind of floating element like a figure, a table, or an algorithm.
