\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

\looseness=-1  % This "might" remove the orphan word.
Start off with a summary of the evaluation section.
What are the questions asked by the evaluations you did -- roughly one per subsection -- and what are the answers in short?
Then, describe your workloads, baselines, methodologies, and metrics.
After you write those, cut the length to half of what you wrote.
