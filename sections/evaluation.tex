\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:eval}

Start off with a summary of the evaluation section.
What are the questions asked by the evaluations you did -- roughly one per subsection -- and what are the answers in short?
Then, describe your workloads, baselines, methodologies, and metrics.
After you write it, cut the length to half of what you wrote.
